**C/C++ Programming**(5)：C/C++ Programming with MinGW-w64（GCC)，MakeFile,the Shared Library

Deadline: 2019.06.09

## To Do(5 marks)：

The exponentiating by squaring is a general method for fast computation of large positive integer powers of a number.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring

Please use the [fastipow.cpp](./src/fastipow.cpp) to do the following tasks:

1. Coding C/C++： **C/C++ code/header**(1 marks)

  Split the [fastipow.cpp](./src/fastipow.cpp) into the two source files:

    *  The function of The Repeated Squaring Method

    *  The example application to call The Repeated Squaring Method

2. Building dll, exe with three **makefiles**(3 marks)

    * Making the executable file with multiple source files: the function of The Repeated Squaring Method and it's caller

    * Making the shared library of the Repeated Squaring Method

    * Making the executable file to call the shared library 

3. Documenting your works: **README.md and Images**：(1 marks)

    * README.md: intro of your works
     
    * The screenshot of coding,making exe to use `the shared library` and running the  executable file

        * display in the README.md
   
     Example:
