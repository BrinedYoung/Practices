 Computer science is now a key problem solving tool in a broad range of industries and scientific disciplines. It is a rigorous academic discipline that is of great importance to everyone, not just those wanting to work in the computing industry. Just a little understanding provides access to a fantastic playground for young minds, where almost anything can be created and explored.   

 Unfortunately, many young people are only ever exposed to ICT (Information Communications Technology）courses rather than the much broader, richer and exciting world of computing. 

 Designing algorithms, using abstraction and decomposition to tackle large problems, selecting appropriate representations, learning how to build correct, robust and scalable systems are now key skills in the information age.

The importance of open source software in science -Almar Klein

Open source software is rising

When I started using Python in 2008, the scientific Python stack was not very mature yet. So although I believed that Python was a great tool for scientists, I did not feel that I could recommend it to my colleagues or students yet.

Wow, a lot has changed since_ then! The development of the scientific Python community is increasing fast, and with that the development of the scientific packages. Many packages can be considered quite mature now. We have also established the Scipy stack, a set of packages that is considered the core of the Scipy ecosystem.
 
Right now, I would definitely recommend Python to anyone who wants to do something related to scientific computing, imaging or data analysis ...
  
At the same time, other very interesting open source projects are being developed that enrich the scientific ecosystem. For example, Julia is a promising language that borrows ideas from Python and Matlab.
 
A similar trend occurs for the reproducibility of scientific results. Any scientific publication that talks of results that cannot be reproduced by others is essentially worthless
